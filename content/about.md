### Hola 👋, I'm Fede

I’m an Argentinian currently based in Dubai, working as a **DevOps & SRE Engineer**. I thrive on continuous learning and focus on areas like **cloud adoption**, **observability**, and **tool administration**. As an **Atlassian consultant**, I specialize in **migrations**, **automation** and **workflow configuration**. I also enjoy exploring **AI applications**, **prompt engineering**, **crypto**, and **Web3**, driven by curiosity and the potential of these technologies to transform industries.

- 🗣 **DevOps** is culture + processes + tools — you can't buy it; you have to adopt it.
- 🚀 Currently growing my skill set in **AI tools** and **prompt engineering**.
- 🌱 Actively learning [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
- 💬 Let’s talk about **DevOps Culture** or anything tech-related!
- ⚙️ My daily tools: `AWS`, `Docker`, `GitLab-CI`, `.tf`, `Ansible`, `sh`.
